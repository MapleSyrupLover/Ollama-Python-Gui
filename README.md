WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT OLLAMA.EXE IS RUNNING ALREADY

This stupid dumb GUI will be replaced with a better one soon!

MY PLANS FOR THIS PROJECT:
1. **Update the UI**
   The current UI really sucks and I plan on making a more modern, easy to use UI
2. **Switching to C#**
   I will keep updating the python version of the UI but I feel that it would be better if I use C# as the main app, right now I am trying to make the UI as perfect as it can be in C#
